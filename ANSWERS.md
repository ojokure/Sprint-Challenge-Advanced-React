Render() Method:It handles the rendering of the component to the UI, It happens during the mounting and updating of the component.

componentDidMount() Method: It is called as soon as the component is mounted and ready. 

componentDidUpdate() Method: It is invoked as soon as the updating happens. It is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
